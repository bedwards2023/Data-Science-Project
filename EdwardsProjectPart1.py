#My two questions I'm attempting to answer
print("The two questions we are attempting to solve are: Does lifestyle influence lung cancer? ")
print("How does the level of poverty in a state relate to its incarceration rates?")

'''
I'm using three data sets:
1. Crime and Incarceration in the United States https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christophercorrea/prisoners-and-crime-in-united-states
2. Poverty estimates https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshuu/poverty-estimates 
3. Statewise crime in USA - K means Clustering https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikramamin/statewise-crime-in-usa-k-means-clustering

For each state and each year between 2011-2017 I will be looking at the poverty estimates for each state, as well as crime and incarceration rates. 
Are incarceration rates correlated to poverty rates? How do states differ in crime rates and poverty rates?
